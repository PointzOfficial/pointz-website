# GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Configuration Fixed

- [x] All assets properly generated

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify dist folder contains:**
   - `index.html` (clean, no redirect scripts needed)
   - All assets in `/assets/` folder
   - All public files (favicon, manifest, etc.)

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Push changes to main branch
   - GitHub Actions will automatically deploy
   - Or manually upload dist folder contents to gh-pages branch

## 🔍 Why HashRouter Works Better

### Issue with BrowserRouter on GitHub Pages:
- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side routing
- Direct URL access (e.g., `/about`) returns 404
- Requires complex 404.html redirect scripts

### Solution with HashRouter:
- ✅ Works out of the box with GitHub Pages
- ✅ No need for 404.html or redirect scripts
- ✅ URLs use hash fragments (e.g., `/#/about`)
- ✅ All routing handled client-side
- ✅ Simpler and more reliable

## 📝 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly at `https://www.bikepointz.com/`
- [ ] Navigation between pages works (URLs will have `#` like `/#/about`)
- [ ] Direct hash URL access works (e.g., `/#/contact`)
- [ ] Assets load properly (images, CSS, JS)
- [ ] Meta tags are correct for social sharing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness works
- [ ] Cookie banner appears
- [ ] All interactive elements work
